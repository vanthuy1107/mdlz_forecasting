# Category-Specific Configuration for MOONCAKE Category
# This file overrides base config.yaml settings for MOONCAKE category training
# Refined for better handling of sparse seasonal data with transfer learning from TET

# Window configuration - For seasonal products, year-over-year features are more important than recent days
# The model will learn from same period last year (cbm_last_year, cbm_2_years_ago features)
# rather than just the last 21 days
window:
  input_size: 21  # 21-day lookback (year-over-year features provide historical context)
  horizon: 30     # 30-day forecast horizon

# Model Configuration - Reduced complexity to prevent overfitting on sparse data
# Layer normalization and weight decay help prevent overfitting to 2023 outlier peaks (495 CBM)
# while still capturing the P90 threshold for the flattening trend (383 CBM in 2025)
model:
  hidden_size: 128  # Reduced from 256 to prevent overfitting on sparse seasonal data
  n_layers: 2       # Reduced from 3 to prevent overfitting
  dropout_prob: 0.2
  use_layer_norm: true  # Layer normalization helps prevent overfitting to 2023 peaks

# Training Configuration - Optimized for sparse seasonal patterns with P90 Risk-Aware Safety Stock Model
training:
  batch_size: 32
  epochs: 50  # Increased from 40 to better learn seasonal patterns
  learning_rate: 0.001  # Increased from 0.0008 to help model learn peak magnitudes better
  weight_decay: 5e-5  # Reduced from 1e-4 to allow model to fit peaks better (less regularization)
  scheduler:
    patience: 3
    factor: 0.5
  loss: "quantile"  # Use Quantile Loss (Pinball Loss) for P90 prediction
  quantile: 0.9  # Target 90th percentile (P90) - ensures only 10% probability of exceeding forecast
  # Quantile Loss provides asymmetric penalty (9x more for under-forecasting):
  # - Higher penalty when actual > prediction (under-forecasting: stock-outs) = 0.9 * error
  # - Lower penalty when actual < prediction (over-forecasting: safety stock) = 0.1 * error
  # Ratio: 0.9/0.1 = 9x more severe penalty for under-forecasting
  # This is critical for MOONCAKE where missing the peak is much costlier than slight over-forecasting

# Category-specific loss weighting - High weight for entire Active Season (70+ days, not just peak day)
# CRITICAL: Loss function penalizes errors in Lunar Month 7.15 to 8.15 window (peak period)
# NEW: Gregorian-Anchored Peak Alignment - Anchor the primary spike signal to August (Gregorian)

    active_season_weight: 25.0  # Increased from 15.0 - stronger weight for entire active season
    august_boost_weight: 100.0  # Increased from 50.0 - EXTREME weight to override lunar month 6 suppression
    primary_event: "lunar_08_01_countdown"  # Use countdown to Lunar 08-01 as primary temporal feature

    use_smooth_l1: false  # Not used with quantile loss
    # NOTE: august_boost_weight=100 teaches model that gregorian August → HIGH predictions
