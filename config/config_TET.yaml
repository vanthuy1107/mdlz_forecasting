# Category-Specific Configuration for TET Category
# This file overrides base config.yaml settings for TET category training

# Window configuration - TET needs focused lookback for seasonal intensity
window:
  input_size: 14  # 14-day lookback focused on seasonal intensity
  horizon: 30     # 30-day forecast horizon

# Model Configuration - TET-specific architecture
model:
  hidden_size: 256  # Larger network to capture complex seasonal patterns
  n_layers: 3       # Deeper network for seasonal dependencies
  dropout_prob: 0.2
  use_layer_norm: true

# Training Configuration - Higher learning rate to capture rapid spikes
training:
  batch_size: 32
  epochs: 60  # More epochs to learn sparse seasonal patterns
  learning_rate: 0.002  # Higher LR to capture rapid spikes
  weight_decay: 1e-4    # Moderate regularization
  scheduler:
    patience: 3
    factor: 0.5

# Category-specific loss weighting - High weight during peak periods
category_specific_params:
  TET:
    learning_rate: 0.002
    epochs: 60
    loss_weight: 3.0  # High weight to capture Tet peak (45 days before Lunar New Year)
    weight_decay: 1e-4

# Seasonal configuration - TET is highly seasonal
data:
  seasonal_active_window: 45  # Active 45 days before Tet
  peak_event: "tet"  # Peak event is Tet (Lunar New Year)
  apply_seasonal_mask: true  # Hard-zero constraint during off-season
