# Category-Specific Configuration for DRY Category
# This file overrides base config.yaml settings for DRY category training

# Window configuration - DRY needs longer lookback for weekly stability
window:
  input_size: 28  # 28-day lookback for weekly pattern stability
  horizon: 20      # 30-day forecast horizon

# Model Configuration - DRY-specific architecture
model:
  hidden_size: 128
  n_layers: 2
  dropout_prob: 0.1  # Lower dropout for stable patterns
  use_layer_norm: true

# Training Configuration - Lower learning rate for stability
training:
  batch_size: 64
  epochs: 20
  learning_rate: 0.0005  # Lower LR for smooth convergence
  weight_decay: 1e-5     # Light regularization
  scheduler:
    patience: 5  # Wait longer before reducing LR
    factor: 0.5

# Category-specific loss weighting
category_specific_params:
  DRY:
    learning_rate: 0.0005
    weight_decay: 1e-5
    patience: 5
    loss_weight: 1.0  # Standard weight for stable category

# Seasonal configuration - DRY is not seasonal
data:
  seasonal_active_window: null  # No seasonal masking for DRY
  peak_event: null  # No peak event countdown
